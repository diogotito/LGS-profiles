# LGS-profiles
My Profile Exports from Logitech Gaming Software

## What is this

I bought a [Logitech G502 Hero](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.910-005469.html) mouse.

It has lots of buttons (11 to be precise) and I wanted to program them all!
So I did.

Then I wanted to have my LGS config and Lua scripts backed up,
so I exported the Profiles I created and pushed them here.
